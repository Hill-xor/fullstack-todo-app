## Lessons Learned
As this will be one of my current projects, I'm aiming at:

* Software Development Life Cycle
* Test Driven Development
* Implementing security as early as possible
* CI/CD workflow with Git Actions
* Docker orchestration (future it'll be with Kubernetes)
* Learn to implement a FullStack app as a Micro-Service


## Optimizations

 - refactors
 - performance improvements
 - accessibility
